CS5331 Web Security OwnCloud Feature Implementation


a. Virtual Assistant (Easy)

 1. You are required to implement a simple guide for new users when they first join the system. The guide is always available in the menu bar for users to access when they need as well.
 2. Prepare a registered user A and provide his information in the readme.
 3. Once user A logs in, a welcome window pops up to offer the assistance. Choosing “I need assistance” means that user A doesn’t understand how to use this online shop application and he/she needs interactive assistance.
 4. Once “I need assistance” is clicked, a virtual assistant and a progress bar are shown. The virtual assistant (pop-up screen) will guide the user A to upload, edit, share and delete a file, right from the very beginning until the task is completed.
 5. Progress bar is shown in every step, starting after user A clicks on “I need assistance” until the user checking out the items.
 6. Provide the “Never shows this in the future” feature to not pop up the window from the next session of the users.
 7. Also provide the link/button to access the guide in the menu bar.


b. File comment (Advanced)

1. This feature is similar to the comment feature that Google Docs provides, though in a simpler form.
2. Create three normal users A, B and C.
3. Choose one random file X from A's repo, and click on “invite to comment” button to invite B.
4. User B will get an email saying that he/she is invited to review a file with instruction about how to access the file. Note that you may have to setup a SMTP Gateway for sending email from your app.
5. User B can see file and start giving comment on it. Every user if invited is able to see who are viewing the file and the previous comment. User C who is not invited cannot give comment, though he/she has the link to the file.
6. User can delete their previous comments while file owner is able to delete any comment.
7. Comments are given on a sidebar, not mixed up with the file (as in Google Drive).
